# Ronch-braggPlot_v05

##Installation/Preliminary operations
1. Install/compile the various versions of ROOT and put them in ~/ROOT/vXX-XX-XX (eg "~/ROOT/v5-34-36").
2. Put the   `SCRIPT_ROOT_ECLIPSE/Documents/root_varie` in `~/Documents` (or modify the scripts).
   
   The reason here is that at the moment, ROOT 5 and ROOT 6 are not compatible. Even worse, gcc 4 and 5's ABis are not
   compatible and root 5 "prefers" g++ 4.x and root 6 g++ 5.x (or clang). So the scripts use update-alternatives
   to select the appropriate compiler (you need to install them both obviously), and they need to use sudo.
   
3. Put the aliases for the shell (bash, zsh, etc) in the corresponding file and source them.
3. Put Eclipse (or modify the scripts, obviously...) in `~/bin/eclipse`
4. Put the scripts to run eclipse (eg `~/SCRIPT_ROOT_ECLIPSE/eclipse_root534.sh`) for example on the Desktop

##Usage
1. Open a terminal and select the root to use with the aliases (eg `root_6_06_select`) or soucing the scripts in `~/Documents/root_varie`
2. Open eclipse using the script corresponding the selected ROOT
3. Compile one of the five configurations in Eclipse
4. Run from the terminal the executable in the corresponding folder, you should see the image
